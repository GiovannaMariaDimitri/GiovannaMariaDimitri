- 👋 Hi, I’m @GiovannaMariaDimitri
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning, computer vision, deep learning and bioinformatics
- 🌱 I obtained my Bachelor and Master degree in Computer and Automation Engineering at the University of Siena (both 110 cum laude, bachelor in 2012 and master in 2014). I then completed an Mphil in Computer Science at the Department of Computer Science, University of Cambridge (UK) in 2014/2015 and I obtained maximum grade with distinction. Subsequently I completed a PhD at the Department of Computer Science under the supervision of Prof. Pietro Liò, at the University of Cambridge (UK). I am now a post-doc researcher at the Department of Engineering, University of Siena, (Italy). 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on computer vision, deep lerning and machine learning.
